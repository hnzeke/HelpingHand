                    <div>Watts is a school located on Avalon Blvd in Los Angeles which helps prepare students for the transition from high school to college, preparing them for a successful future. The school has great ambitions of providing programs & food. With extra funding from sponsors, they could have many more extracurricular activities that could help students prepare for college. With the money that they get, they will introduce more sports for Watts such as Football, Track, Baseball, and Cross Country. This money will give the school more nutri lunches to energize us to learn and soar high academicdaly. </div>
